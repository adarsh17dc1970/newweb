# Surplus Food Distribution Project

## Overview

This project aims to collect surplus food from events, redistribute it to people in need, and, when the shelf life of the food expires, send it to farms for animal feed or compost silos. By doing so, we aim to reduce food waste, help communities in need, and contribute to sustainable farming practices.
